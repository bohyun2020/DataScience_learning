iOS and iPadOS App Store
Main article: App Store (iOS) ยง Application ratings
Apple's rating system for the App Store follows the following rubric:[1]

Rated 4+: Contains no objectionable material.
Rated 9+: May contain content unsuitable for children under the age of 9.
Rated 12+: May contain content unsuitable for children under the age of 12.
Rated 17+: May contain content unsuitable for children under the age of 17.
Apps rated 17+ are prohibited from purchase by younger users.[2]

Google Play
Up until March 17, 2015 Google Play used the following rubric:[3][4]

Everyone
Low maturity
Medium maturity
High maturity
Google now uses the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) in most countries not represented by a rating authority, whilst countries or regions with a superimposed video game rating authority (e.g. ESRB and PEGI) continues applying their own ratings where applicable.[5] However, a new Google Play Rating system is used exclusively for non-gaming apps in South Korea.[6] These ratings include:

3+
7+
12+
16+
18+
