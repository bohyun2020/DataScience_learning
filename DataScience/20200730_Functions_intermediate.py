# 1. Interfering with the Built-in Functions

    Using the names of built-in functions to name our own functions is highly 
    discouraged because it may lead to abnormal function behavior, and it can 
    also confuse other people reading our code.

    using the name sum() for our function above interferes with the built-in 
    sum() function. When we call sum(), Python won't run the built-in sum() 
    function anymore — it will run instead the sum() function that we wrote.

    Run the code del max to delete the max() function you wrote.
    This will allow you to use the built-in max() function again.

    With the exception of the file parameter, we can see that all parameters 
    have default arguments. This means the only argument we must pass in is 
    for the file parameter.

    This example shows us how useful default arguments really are. 
    With the help of default arguments, we can use a complex function like 
    open() only by passing the file name. If open() didn't have any default 
    argument, then we'd have to pass in arguments for all the parameters.

    This kind of temporary memory storage doesn't apply to the code that is being 
    run outside function definitions. If we define x = 3.14 in our main program

    worry that it was erased from memory.
